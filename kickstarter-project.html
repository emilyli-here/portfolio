				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
				The purpose of this project was to take an already existing phone app and create a new feature that could be potentially useful in the user goals.
				</p>
				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>
					I was put in charge of doing design mockups and prototyping. As well as the initial research process of the feature design. During the time of the pandemic, we had to work together collaboratively on Figma where I designed the mockups and wireflows.

					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>
						From our research on the Kickstarter app, we wanted to create something that is unique to the app and not just a feature on the website that is re-created on the app. The most prominent idea that was well-liked by the teaching team and our peers was a feature for users to keep track of the pledge spending: The Pledge Tracker.

						My job was to make our "Pledge Tracker" UI look like it would be a part of the existing app interface. I had to make a flow of how it would connect to the existings features of the app. In addition, I was responsible for the creating the different interactivities involved in our feature design. For example, I had designed a way to see pledges by breakdown of fees and pledges.

					<h2>Feature Goals</h2>
					<p>
						The end goal of our design was to make it easier for users to keep track of their pledges and ongoing projects. We wanted to understand how users determine the amount they pledge and the reason they pledge to these projects.s

				</div>
				<p>
					Since this was my first time doing UX/UI design I found it a eye-opening experience. From the feedbacks of the teaching team, my design was focus too heavily on a "info graphic" style rather than the experience of the feature itself. The "Pledge Tracker" feature only considered users that make pledges often on kickstarter, which discluded a large chunk of people.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further thinking, I would replace the graph break down design I had and add a option for users to set a max limit on their spendings. Once a user reaches that limit, it will prompt them to adjust any ongoing project pledges or raise their spending limit.
