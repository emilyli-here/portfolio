				<h2>Overview</h2>

				For this project, the goal is build a fully funcational front-end ecommerce website using HTML5 and CSS. 
				</p>
				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>
					In this project, I was the one maintainging the our Git Repository organization and overall cleaning any code at the end of the project. Both my partner and I split the code work equally between the two of us.

					<h2>Mock-up & Wireframe</h2>
					<p>
						Before building the our site, we made wireflows to help us create a general idea of our website flow. However, some of our flows had to be adjusted along the way, wireflowing still allowed my partner and I to mutually understand each others code. An example of a change from our inital design was a pop-up detail pages when the users clicks on each product but as we coded our site we found it was not practical and is difficult to make resposive.

					<h2>Coding Together</h2>
					<p>
						To work collaboratively together, GitKraken was the prime source we used to sync and merge our codes together. This method allowed us to work on the same files together remotely. Throughout this process we learn to become more organize and help each other by writing detail notes for the

					During the filming, I took on the role of a director and director of photograpy. Stepping up to take on these roles, allowed me to become a lead in my project, guiding my members through the process.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					As my first narrative short film, I learnt a lot about film production and team cooperation. It takes a lot of planning and understanding of the equipments to produce a well executed film. The biggest takeaway from this experience is the pre-production planning. A well-structured timeline of your project can lessen the stress on production and post-production.
